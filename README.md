### Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future Apple stock prices. The model will be trained on historical Apple stock price data, including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. After data preprocessing and feature engineering, the LSTM model will be trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict future stock prices based on past trends and patterns.
